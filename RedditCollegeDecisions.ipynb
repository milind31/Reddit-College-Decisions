        "r/ApplyingToCollege is a subreddit for high school students to discuss college admissions. Every year, once admissions decisions are released, there are megathreads set up for students to discuss whether or not they got in and what their grades, test scores, extracurriculars, etc. were like so other students can gauge how competitive admissions were for that college in that year. In this notebook, I scrape all posts from the megathreads for UC Davis from the last 3 years; naively extract SAT scores, unweighted GPAs, and admissions statuses from these posts; and use k-nearest neighbors to predict a student's admission status given their SAT score and unweighted GPA.\r\n",

        "Disclaimer: My code attempts a very simple approach of taking two parameters to predict admission status and fails to take into account many other factors in the college admissions process such as extracurriculars, essays, family income, etc. This is definitely something I would like to improve upon in the future."

After thinking about using this model practically, I figured that a user would rather see more accurate results displaying only a prediction of acceptance or rejection over less accurate results displaying a prediction of being waitlisted as well. In addition, we do not lose a significant amount of data since there weren't a great deal of waitlists."

However, it appears that our model will trade off correctly picking acceptences with the highest accuracy possible for picking rejections with higher accuracy as well if we allow k to be on the smaller end. Our acceptance accuracy will be lower than guessing everything as an acceptance, but our rejection accuracy will be much higher. We can play around with this number to see what works best.
